    /* Time Complexity:
        Building the Min Heap:

       a. For each element in the input array arr[], we perform an insertion operation into the min heap.
       b. Each insertion into the min heap takes O(log k) time, where k is the size of the heap.
       c. Since we iterate over all n elements of the array, the total time complexity for this step is O(n * log k).
          Retrieving the k Largest Elements:

       a. After the min heap contains at most k elements, we retrieve (poll) the smallest element k times.
       b. Each retrieval operation (poll) from the min heap takes O(log k) time.
       c. Since we retrieve k elements, the total time complexity for this step is O(k * log k).
         Combining both steps, the total time complexity of the kLargest method is the sum of the time complexities of building the min heap and retrieving the k largest elements:

          Total Time Complexity = O(n * log k) + O(k * log k)

Now, let's analyze this further:

When k is much smaller than n, i.e., k << n, then O(n * log k) dominates the time complexity.
When k approaches n, i.e., k â‰ˆ n, then O(k * log k) becomes significant.
However, in most cases, k is much smaller than n, so the overall time complexity is primarily determined by O(n * log k).
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the kLargest method is O(n * log k).
